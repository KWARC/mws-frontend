      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">28.4 <span class="Heading">General Hash Tables</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These sections describe some particularities for hash tables. These are intended mainly for extending the implementation - programs requiring hash functionality ought to use the dictionary interface described above.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We hash by keys and also store a value. Keys cannot be removed from the table, but the corresponding value can be changed. Fast access to last hash index allows you to efficiently store more than one array of values â€“this facility should be used with care.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This code works for any kind of object, provided you have a <code class="func">DenseIntKey</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap28_mj.html#X79DEEB5783513838"><span class="RefLink">28.5-1</span></a>) method to convert the key into a positive integer. This method should ideally be implemented efficiently in the core.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that, for efficiency, it is currently impossible to create a hash table with non-positive integers.</p> </body>
