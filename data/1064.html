Namely, an operation corresponds to a set of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> functions, called the <em>methods</em> of the operation.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each call of an operation causes a suitable method to be selected and then called. The choice of which method to select is made according to the types of the arguments, the underlying mechanism is described in the following sections.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examples of operations are the binary infix operators <code class="code">=</code>, <code class="code">+</code> etc., and <code class="func">PrintObj</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap6_mj.html#X815BF22186FD43C9"><span class="RefLink">6.3-5</span></a>) is the operation that is called for each argument of <code class="func">Print</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap6_mj.html#X7AFA64D97A1F39A3"><span class="RefLink">6.3-4</span></a>).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also all attributes and properties are operations. Each attribute has a special method which is called if the attribute value is already stored; this method of course simply returns this value.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The setter of an attribute is called automatically if an attribute value has been computed. Attribute setters are operations, too. They have a default method that ignores the request to store the value. Depending on the type of the object, there may be another method to store the value in a suitable way, and then set the attribute tester for the object to <code class="keyw">true</code>.</p> </body>
