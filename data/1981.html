      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">44.7 <span class="Heading">Acting OnRight and OnLeft</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>, matrices by convention act on row vectors from the right, whereas in crystallography the convention is to act on column vectors from the left. The definition of certain algebraic objects important in crystallography implicitly depends on which action is assumed. This holds true in particular for quadratic forms invariant under a matrix group. In a similar way, the representation of affine crystallographic groups, as they are provided by the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> package <strong class="pkg">CrystGap</strong>, depends on which action is assumed. Crystallographers are used to the action from the left, whereas the action from the right is the natural one for <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>. For this reason, a number of functions which are important in crystallography, and whose result depends on which action is assumed, are provided in two versions, one for the usual action from the right, and one for the crystallographic action from the left.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For every such function, this fact is explicitly mentioned. The naming scheme is as follows: If <code class="code">SomeThing</code> is such a function, there will be functions <code class="code">SomeThingOnRight</code> and <code class="code">SomeThingOnLeft</code>, assuming action from the right and from the left, respectively. In addition, there is a generic function <code class="code">SomeThing</code>, which returns either the result of <code class="code">SomeThingOnRight</code> or <code class="code">SomeThingOnLeft</code>, depending on the global variable <code class="func">CrystGroupDefaultAction</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap44_mj.html#X7D1318A6780CD88B"><span class="RefLink">44.7-1</span></a>).</p> </body>
