      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">86.1 <span class="Heading">Weak Pointer Objects</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A <em>weak pointer object</em> is similar to a mutable plain list, except that it does not keep its subobjects alive during a garbage collection. From the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> viewpoint this means that its entries may become unbound, apparently spontaneously, at any time. Considerable care is therefore needed in programming with such an object.</p> </body>
