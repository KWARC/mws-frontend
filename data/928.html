      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">77.5 <span class="Heading">The former .gaprc file</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Up to <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> 4.4, a file <code class="file">.gaprc</code> in the user's home directory (if available, and <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> was started without <code class="code">-r</code> option) was read automatically during startup, early enough for influencing the autoloading of packages and late enough for being allowed to execute any <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> code. On Windows machines this file was called <code class="file">gap.rc</code>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> 4.5 the startup mechanism has changed, see <a shape="rect" href="chap3_mj.html#X7FD66F977A3B02DF"><span class="RefLink">3.2</span></a> for details. These new configuration files are now contained in a directory <code class="code">GAPInfo.UserGapRoot</code>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the sake of partial backwards compatibility, also the former file <code class="file">~/.gaprc</code> is still supported for such initializations, but this file is read only if the directory <code class="code">GAPInfo.UserGapRoot</code> does not exist. In that case the <code class="file">~/.gaprc</code> is read at the same time as <code class="file">gaprc</code> would be read, i. e., too late for influencing the startup of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As before, the command line option <code class="code">-r</code> disables reading <code class="file">~/.gaprc</code>, see <a shape="rect" href="chap3_mj.html#X782751D5858A6EAF"><span class="RefLink">3.1</span></a>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To migrate from the old setup to the new one introduced with <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> 4.5, first have a look at the function <code class="func">WriteGapIniFile</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap3_mj.html#X7B0AD104839B6C3C"><span class="RefLink">3.2-3</span></a>). Many users will find that all or most of what was set in the old <code class="file">~/.gaprc</code> file can now be done via the user preferences in a <code class="file">gap.ini</code> file. If you had code for new functions or abbreviations in your old <code class="file">~/.gaprc</code> file or you were reading additional files, then move this into the file <code class="file">gaprc</code> (without the leading dot, same name for all operating systems) in the directory <code class="code">GAPInfo.UserGapRoot</code>.</p> </body>
