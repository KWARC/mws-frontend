      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">76.1 <span class="Heading">Installing a GAP Package</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before a package can be used it must be installed. With a standard installation of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> there should be all currently redistributed with <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> packages already available. But since <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> packages are released independently of the main <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> system it may be sensible to upgrade or install new packages between upgrades of your <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> installation.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A package consists of a collection of files within a single directory that must be a subdirectory of the <code class="file">pkg</code> directory in one of the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> root directories, see <a shape="rect" href="chap9_mj.html#X7A4973627A5DB27D"><span class="RefLink">9.2</span></a>. (If you don't have access to the <code class="file">pkg</code> directory in your main <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> installation you can add private root directories as explained in that section.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whenever you get from somewhere an archive of a <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> package it should be accompanied with a <code class="file">README</code> file that explains its installation. Some packages just consist of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> code and the installation is done by unpacking the archive in one of the places described above. There are also packages that need further installation steps, there may be for example some external programs which have to be compiled (this is often done by just saying <code class="code">./configure; make</code> inside the unpacked package directory, but check the individual <code class="file">README</code> files). Note that if you use Windows you may not be able to use some or all external binaries.</p> </body>
