      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.3 <span class="Heading">Saving and Loading a Workspace</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> workspace files are binary files that contain the data of a <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> session. One can produce a workspace file with <code class="func">SaveWorkspace</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap3_mj.html#X876544A57C73C488"><span class="RefLink">3.3-1</span></a>), and load it into a new <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> session using the <code class="code">-L</code> command line option, see Section <a shape="rect" href="chap3_mj.html#X782751D5858A6EAF"><span class="RefLink">3.1</span></a>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One purpose of workspace files is of course the possibility to save a &quot;snapshot&quot; image of the current <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> workspace in a file.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The recommended way to start <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> is to load an existing workspace file, because this reduces the startup time of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> drastically. So if you have installed <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> yourself then you should think about creating a workspace file immediately after you have started <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>, and then using this workspace file later on, whenever you start <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>. If your <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> installation is shared between several users, the system administrator should think about providing such a workspace file.</p> </body>
