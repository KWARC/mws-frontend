      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">31.2 <span class="Heading">Equality and Comparison of Domains</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><em>Equality</em> and <em>comparison</em> of domains are defined as follows.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two domains are considered <em>equal</em> if and only if the sets of their elements as computed by <code class="func">AsSSortedList</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap30_mj.html#X856D927378C33548"><span class="RefLink">30.3-10</span></a>)) are equal. Thus, in general <code class="code">=</code> behaves as if each domain operand were replaced by its set of elements. Except that <code class="code">=</code> will also sometimes, but not always, work for infinite domains, for which of course <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> cannot compute the set of elements. Note that this implies that domains with different algebraic structure may well be equal. As a special case of this, either operand of <code class="code">=</code> may also be a proper set (see <a shape="rect" href="chap21_mj.html#X80ABC25582343910"><span class="RefLink">21.19</span></a>), i.e., a sorted list without holes or duplicates (see <code class="func">AsSSortedList</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap30_mj.html#X856D927378C33548"><span class="RefLink">30.3-10</span></a>)), and <code class="code">=</code> will return <code class="keyw">true</code> if and only if this proper set is equal to the set of elements of the argument that is a domain.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><em>No</em> general <em>ordering</em> of arbitrary domains via <code class="code">&lt;</code> is defined in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> 4. This is because a well-defined <code class="code">&lt;</code> for domains or, more general, for collections, would have to be compatible with <code class="code">=</code> and would need to be transitive and antisymmetric in order to be used to form ordered sets. In particular, <code class="code">&lt;</code> would have to be independent of the algebraic structure of its arguments because this holds for <code class="code">=</code>, and thus there would be hardly a situation where one could implement an efficient comparison method. (Note that in the case that two domains are comparable with <code class="code">&lt;</code>, the result is in general <em>not</em> compatible with the set theoretical subset relation, which can be decided with <code class="func">IsSubset</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap30_mj.html#X79CA175481F8105F"><span class="RefLink">30.5-1</span></a>).)</p> </body>
