      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">7.11 <span class="Heading">Global Memory Information</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> environment provides automatic memory management, so that the programmer does not need to concern themselves with allocating space for objects, or recovering space when objects are no longer needed. The component of the kernel which provides this is called <code class="code">GASMAN</code> (<strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> Storage MANager). Messages reporting garbage collections performed by <code class="code">GASMAN</code> can be switched on by the <code class="code">-g</code> command line option (see section <a shape="rect" href="chap3_mj.html#X782751D5858A6EAF"><span class="RefLink">3.1</span></a>). There are also some facilities to access information from <code class="code">GASMAN</code> from <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> programs.</p> </body>
