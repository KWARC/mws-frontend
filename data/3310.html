      <body> <h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">80.8-3 <span class="Heading">Example: Groups with a decomposition as semidirect product</span></h5><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The third example is groups which have a (nontrivial) decomposition as a semidirect product. If this information has been found out, we want to be able to use it in algorithms. (Thus we do not only need the fact <em>that</em> there is a decomposition, but also the decomposition itself.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also want this to be applicable to every group and not only for groups which have been explicitly constructed via <code class="func">SemidirectProduct</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap49_mj.html#X7D905A5778D7ACDE"><span class="RefLink">49.2-1</span></a>).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Instead we simply declare an attribute <code class="code">SemidirectProductDecomposition</code> for groups. (Again, in this manual we don't go in the details of how such an decomposition would look like).</p><div class="example" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><pre xml:space="preserve">
DeclareAttribute(&quot;SemidirectProductDecomposition&quot;,IsGroup);
</pre></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If a decomposition has been found, it can be stored in a group using <code class="code">SetSemidirectProductDecomposition</code>. (At the moment all groups in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> are attribute storing.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Methods that rely on the existence of such a decomposition then get installed for the tester filter <code class="code">HasSemidirectProductDecomposition</code>.</p> </body>
