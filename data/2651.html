      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">13.8 <span class="Heading">Other Filters</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are situations where one wants to express a kind of knowledge that is based on some heuristic.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For example, the filters (see <a shape="rect" href="chap13_mj.html#X84EFA4C07D4277BB"><span class="RefLink">13.2</span></a>) <code class="func">CanEasilyTestMembership</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap39_mj.html#X798F13EA810FB215"><span class="RefLink">39.25-1</span></a>) and <code class="func">CanEasilyComputePcgs</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap45_mj.html#X7B561B1685CEC2AB"><span class="RefLink">45.2-3</span></a>) are defined in the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> library. Note that such filters do not correspond to a mathematical concept, contrary to properties (see <a shape="rect" href="chap13_mj.html#X871597447BB998A1"><span class="RefLink">13.7</span></a>). Also it need not be defined what &quot;easily&quot; means for an arbitrary <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> object, and in this case one cannot compute the value for an arbitrary <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> object. In order to access this kind of knowledge as a part of the type of an object, <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> provides filters for which the value is <code class="keyw">false</code> by default, and it is changed to <code class="keyw">true</code> in certain situations, either explicitly (for the given object) or via a logical implication (see <a shape="rect" href="chap78_mj.html#X7FB5016E83DB4349"><span class="RefLink">78.7</span></a>) from other filters.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For example, a <code class="keyw">true</code> value of <code class="func">CanEasilyComputePcgs</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap45_mj.html#X7B561B1685CEC2AB"><span class="RefLink">45.2-3</span></a>) for a group means that certain methods are applicable that use a pcgs (see <a shape="rect" href="chap45_mj.html#X7F18A01785DBAC4E"><span class="RefLink">45.1</span></a>) for the group. There are logical implications to set the filter value to <code class="keyw">true</code> for permutation groups that are known to be solvable, and for groups that have already a (sufficiently nice) pcgs stored. In the case one has a solvable matrix group and wants to enable methods that use a pcgs, one can set the <code class="func">CanEasilyComputePcgs</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap45_mj.html#X7B561B1685CEC2AB"><span class="RefLink">45.2-3</span></a>) value to <code class="keyw">true</code> for this particular group.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A filter <var class="Arg">filt</var> of the kind described here is different from the other filters introduced in the previous sections. In particular, <var class="Arg">filt</var> is not a category (see <a shape="rect" href="chap13_mj.html#X7CC6903E78F24167"><span class="RefLink">13.3</span></a>) or a property (see <a shape="rect" href="chap13_mj.html#X871597447BB998A1"><span class="RefLink">13.7</span></a>) because its value may change for a given object, and <var class="Arg">filt</var> is not a representation (see <a shape="rect" href="chap13_mj.html#X8698205F8648EB33"><span class="RefLink">13.4</span></a>) because it has nothing to do with the way an object is made up from some data. <var class="Arg">filt</var> is similar to an attribute tester (see <a shape="rect" href="chap13_mj.html#X79DE5208877AE42A"><span class="RefLink">13.6</span></a>), the only difference is that <var class="Arg">filt</var> does not refer to an attribute value; note that <var class="Arg">filt</var> is also used in the same way as an attribute tester; namely, the <code class="keyw">true</code> value may be required for certain methods to be applicable.</p> </body>
