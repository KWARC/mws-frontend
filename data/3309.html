This topic is discussed in much more detail in chapterÂ <a shape="rect" href="chap82_mj.html#X7E485C967A5778C9"><span class="RefLink">82</span></a>, in this section we present a simple approach that may be useful to get started but does not permit you to exploit all potential features.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The basic design is that the user designs some way to represent her objects in terms of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>s built-in types, for example as a list or a record. We call this the &quot;defining data&quot; of the new objects. Also provided are functions that perform arithmetic on this &quot;defining data&quot;, that is they take objects of this form and return objects that represent the result of the operation. The function <code class="func">ArithmeticElementCreator</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap80_mj.html#X87A88E3D7F6E2A7C"><span class="RefLink">80.9-1</span></a>) then is called to provide a wrapping such that proper new <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>-objects are created which can be multiplied etc. with the default infix operations such as <code class="code">*</code>.</p> </body>
