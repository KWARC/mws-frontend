      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4.1 <span class="Heading">Language Overview</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First we have the input to <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>, given as a string of characters. How those characters enter <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> is operating system dependent, e.g., they might be entered at a terminal, pasted with a mouse into a window, or read from a file. The mechanism does not matter. This representation of expressions by characters is called the <em>external representation</em> of the expression. Every expression has at least one external representation that can be entered to get exactly this expression.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The input, i.e., the external representation, is transformed in a process called <em>reading</em> to an internal representation. At this point the input is analyzed and inputs that are not legal external representations, according to the rules given below, are rejected as errors. Those rules are usually called the <em>syntax</em> of a programming language.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The internal representation created by reading is called either an <em>expression</em> or a <em>statement</em>. Later we will distinguish between those two terms. However for now we will use them interchangeably. The exact form of the internal representation does not matter. It could be a string of characters equal to the external representation, in which case the reading would only need to check for errors. It could be a series of machine instructions for the processor on which <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> is running, in which case the reading would more appropriately be called compilation. It is in fact a tree-like structure.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the input has been read it is again transformed in a process called <em>evaluation</em> or <em>execution</em>. Later we will distinguish between those two terms too, but for the moment we will use them interchangeably. The name hints at the nature of this process, it replaces an expression with the value of the expression. This works recursively, i.e., to evaluate an expression first the subexpressions are evaluated and then the value of the expression is computed from those values according to rules given below. Those rules are usually called the <em>semantics</em> of a programming language.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The result of the evaluation is, not surprisingly, called a <em>value</em>. Again the form in which such a value is represented internally does not matter. It is in fact a tree-like structure again.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The last process is called <em>printing</em>. It takes the value produced by the evaluation and creates an external representation, i.e., a string of characters again. What you do with this external representation is up to you. You can look at it, paste it with the mouse into another window, or write it to a file.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lets look at an example to make this more clear. Suppose you type in the following string of 8 characters</p><div class="example" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><pre xml:space="preserve">
1 + 2 * 3;
</pre></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> takes this external representation and creates a tree-like internal representation, which we can picture as follows</p><div class="example" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><pre xml:space="preserve">
  +
 / \
1   *
   / \
  2   3
</pre></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This expression is then evaluated. To do this <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> first evaluates the right subexpression <code class="code">2*3</code>. Again, to do this <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> first evaluates its subexpressions 2 and 3. However they are so simple that they are their own value, we say that they are self-evaluating. After this has been done, the rule for <code class="code">*</code> tells us that the value is the product of the values of the two subexpressions, which in this case is clearly 6. Combining this with the value of the left operand of the <code class="code">+</code>, which is self-evaluating, too, gives us the value of the whole expression 7. This is then printed, i.e., converted into the external representation consisting of the single character <code class="code">7</code>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this fashion we can predict the result of every input when we know the syntactic rules that govern the process of reading and the semantic rules that tell us for every expression how its value is computed in terms of the values of the subexpressions.
