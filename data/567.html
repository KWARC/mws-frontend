      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">71.2 <span class="Heading">History of Character Theory Stuff in GAP</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> provides functions for dealing with group characters since the version <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> 3.1, which was released in March 1992. The reason for adding this branch of mathematics to the topics of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> was (apart from the usefulness of character theoretic computations in general) the insight that <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> provides an ideal environment for developing the algorithms needed. In particular, it had been decided at Lehrstuhl D für Mathematik that the <strong class="pkg">CAS</strong> system (a standalone Fortran program together with a database of character tables, see <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBNPP84">[NPP84]</a>) should not be developed further and the functionality of <strong class="pkg">CAS</strong> should be made available in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>. The background was that extending <strong class="pkg">CAS</strong> (by new Fortran code) had turned out to be much less flexible than writing analogous <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> library code.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For integrating the existing character theory algorithms, <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>'s memory management and long integer arithmetic were useful as well as the list handling –it is an important feature of character theoretic methods that questions about groups are translated into manipulations of lists; on the other hand, the datatype of cyclotomics (see Chapter <code class="func">Cyclotomics</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap18_mj.html#X863D1E017BC9EB7F"><span class="RefLink">18.1-2</span></a>)) was added to the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> kernel because of the character theory algorithms. For developing further code, also other areas of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>'s library became interesting, such as permutation groups, finite fields, and polynomials.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The development of character theory code for <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> has been supported by several DFG grants, in particular the project &quot;Representation Theory of Finite Groups and Finite Dimensional Algebras&quot; (until 1991), and the Schwerpunkt &quot;Algorithmische Zahlentheorie und Algebra&quot; (from 1991 until 1997). Besides that, several Diploma theses at Lehrstuhl D were concerned with the development and/or implementation of algorithms dealing with characters in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The major contributions can be listed as follows.</p><ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li><p>The arithmetic for the cyclotomics data type, following <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBZum89">[Zum89]</a>, was first implemented by Marco van Meegen; an alternative approach was studied in the diploma thesis of Michael Scherner (see <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBScherner92">[Sch92]</a>) but was not efficient enough; later Martin Schönert replaced the implementation by a better one.</p>

</li><li><p>The basic routines for characters and character tables were written by Thomas Breuer and Götz Pfeiffer.</p>

</li><li><p>The lattice related functions, such as <code class="func">LLL</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap72_mj.html#X85B360C085B360C0"><span class="RefLink">72.10-4</span></a>), <code class="func">OrthogonalEmbeddings</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap25_mj.html#X842280C2808FF05D"><span class="RefLink">25.6-1</span></a>), and <code class="func">DnLattice</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap72_mj.html#X85D510DC873A99B4"><span class="RefLink">72.10-8</span></a>), were implemented by Ansgar Kaup (see <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBKaup92">[Kau92]</a>).</p>

</li><li><p>Functions for computing possible class fusions, possible power maps, and table automorphisms were written by Thomas Breuer (see <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBBre91">[Bre91]</a>).</p>

</li><li><p>Functions for computing possible permutation characters were written by Thomas Breuer (see <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBBre91">[Bre91]</a>) and Götz Pfeiffer (see <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBPfe91">[Pfe91]</a>).</p>

</li><li><p>Functions for computing character tables from groups were written by Alexander Hulpke (Dixon-Schneider algorithm, see <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBHulpke93">[Hul93]</a>) and Hans Ulrich Besche (Baum algorithm and Conlon algorithm, see <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBBesche92">[Bes92]</a>).</p>

</li><li><p>Functions for dealing with Clifford matrices were written by Ute Schiffer (see <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBSchiffer94">[Sch94]</a>).</p>

</li><li><p>Functions for monomiality questions were written by Thomas Breuer and Erzsébet Horváth.</p>

</li></ul><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since then, the code has been maintained and extended further by Alexander Hulpke (code related to his implementation of the Dixon-Schneider algorithm) and Thomas Breuer.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Currently <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> does not provide special functionality for computing Brauer character tables, but there is an interface to the <strong class="pkg">MOC</strong> system (see <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBHJLP92">[HJLP]</a>), and the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> Character Table Library contains many known Brauer character tables.</p> </body>
