      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">27.2 <span class="Heading">Special Characters</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are a number of <em>special character sequences</em> that can be used between the singlequotes of a character literal or between the doublequotes of a string literal to specify characters. They consist of two characters. The first is a backslash <code class="code">\</code>. The second may be any character. If it is an octal digit (from <code class="code">0</code> to <code class="code">7</code>) there must be two more such digits. The meaning is given in the following list</p><dl xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><dt><strong class="Mark"><code class="code">\n</code></strong></dt><dd><p><em>newline character</em>. This is the character that, at least on UNIX systems, separates lines in a text file. Printing of this character in a string has the effect of moving the cursor down one line and back to the beginning of the line.</p>

</dd><dt><strong class="Mark">


<code class="code">\&quot;</code></strong></dt><dd><p><em>doublequote character</em>. Inside a string a doublequote must be escaped by the backslash, because it is otherwise interpreted as end of the string.</p>

</dd><dt><strong class="Mark">


<code class="code">\'</code></strong></dt><dd><p><em>singlequote character</em>. Inside a character a singlequote must escaped by the backslash, because it is otherwise interpreted as end of the character.</p>

</dd><dt><strong class="Mark">


<code class="code">\\</code></strong></dt><dd><p><em>backslash character</em>. Inside a string a backslash must be escaped by another backslash, because it is otherwise interpreted as first character of an escape sequence.</p>

</dd><dt><strong class="Mark">


<code class="code">\b</code></strong></dt><dd><p><em>backspace character</em>. Printing this character should have the effect of moving the cursor back one character. Whether it works or not is system dependent and should not be relied upon.</p>

</dd><dt><strong class="Mark">


<code class="code">\r</code></strong></dt><dd><p><em>carriage return character</em>. Printing this character should have the effect of moving the cursor back to the beginning of the same line. Whether this works or not is again system dependent.</p>

</dd><dt><strong class="Mark">


<code class="code">\c</code></strong></dt><dd><p><em>flush character</em>. This character is not printed. Its purpose is to flush the output queue. Usually <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> waits until it sees a <code class="code">newline</code> before it prints a string. If you want to display a string that does not include this character use <code class="code">\c</code>.</p>

</dd><dt><strong class="Mark">


<code class="code">\XYZ</code></strong></dt><dd><p>with <code class="code">X</code>, <code class="code">Y</code>, <code class="code">Z</code> three octal digits. This is translated to the character corresponding to the number <code class="code">X * 64 + Y * 8 + Z modulo 256</code>. This can be used to specify and store arbitrary binary data as a string in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>.</p>

</dd><dt><strong class="Mark">

other</strong></dt><dd><p>For any other character the backslash is simply ignored.</p>

</dd></dl><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Again, if the line is displayed as result of an evaluation, those escape sequences are displayed in the same way that they are input.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Only <code class="func">Print</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap6_mj.html#X7AFA64D97A1F39A3"><span class="RefLink">6.3-4</span></a>), <code class="func">PrintTo</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap9_mj.html#X86956C577FFEE1F9"><span class="RefLink">9.7-3</span></a>), or <code class="func">AppendTo</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap9_mj.html#X86956C577FFEE1F9"><span class="RefLink">9.7-3</span></a>) send the characters directly to the output stream.</p><div class="example" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><pre xml:space="preserve">
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">&quot;This is one line.\nThis is another line.\n&quot;;</span>
&quot;This is one line.\nThis is another line.\n&quot;
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">Print( last );</span>
This is one line.
This is another line.
</pre></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note in particular that it is not allowed to enclose a <var class="Arg">newline</var> inside the string. You can use the special character sequence <code class="code">\n</code> to write strings that include <var class="Arg">newline</var> characters. If, however, an input string is too long to fit on a single line it is possible to <em>continue</em> it over several lines. In this case the last character of each input line, except the last line must be a backslash. Both backslash and <var class="Arg">newline</var> are thrown away by <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> while reading the string. Note that the same continuation mechanism is available for identifiers and integers, seeÂ <a shape="rect" href="chap6_mj.html#X866092F281910B74"><span class="RefLink">6.2</span></a>. The rules on escaping are ignored in a triple quoted string, see <a shape="rect" href="chap27_mj.html#X7E70384E7D0B7083"><span class="RefLink">27.3</span></a></p> </body>
