In other words, the applicable method is called that is subsequent to the one that called <code class="func">TryNextMethod</code>, according to decreasing rank of the methods.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For example, since every finite group of odd order is solvable, one may install a method for the property <code class="func">IsSolvableGroup</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap39_mj.html#X809C78D5877D31DF"><span class="RefLink">39.15-6</span></a>) that checks whether the size of the argument is an odd integer, returns <code class="keyw">true</code> if so, and gives up otherwise.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Care is needed if a partial method might modify the type of one of its arguments, for example by computing an attribute or property. If this happens, and the type has really changed, then the method should not exit using <code class="code">TryNextMethod()</code> but should call the operation again, as the new information in the type may cause some methods previously judged inapplicable to be applicable. For example, if the above method for <code class="func">IsSolvableGroup</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap39_mj.html#X809C78D5877D31DF"><span class="RefLink">39.15-6</span></a>) actually computes the size, (rather than just examining a stored size), then it must take care to check whether the type of the group has changed.</p> </body>
