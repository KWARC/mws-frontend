      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">66.20 <span class="Heading">The Representations of Rational Functions</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> uses four representations of rational functions: Rational functions given by numerator and denominator, polynomials, univariate rational functions (given by coefficient lists for numerator and denominator and valuation) and Laurent polynomials (given by coefficient list and valuation).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These representations do not necessarily reflect mathematical properties: While an object in the Laurent polynomials representation must be a Laurent polynomial it might turn out that a rational function given by numerator and denominator is actually a Laurent polynomial and the property tests in section <a shape="rect" href="chap66_mj.html#X7D871EA180E9486C"><span class="RefLink">66.4</span></a> will find this out.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each representation is associated one or several &quot;defining attributes&quot; that give an &quot;external&quot; representation (see <a shape="rect" href="chap66_mj.html#X7F44CF87801DB965"><span class="RefLink">66.21</span></a>) of the representation in the form of lists and are the defining information that tells a rational function what it is.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> also implements methods to compute these attributes for rational functions in <em>other</em> representations, provided it would be possible to express an <em>mathematically equal</em> rational function in the representation associated with the attribute. (That is one can always get a numerator/denominator representation of a polynomial while an arbitrary function of course can compute a polynomial representation only if it is a polynomial.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Therefore these attributes can be thought of as &quot;conceptual&quot; representations that allow us –as far as possible– to consider an object as a rational function, a polynomial or a Laurent polynomial, regardless of the way it is represented in the computer.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Functions thus usually do not need to care about the representation of a rational function. Depending on its (known in the context or determined) properties, they can access the attribute representing the rational function in the desired way.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consequentially, methods for rational functions are installed for properties and not for representations.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When <em>creating</em> new rational functions however they must be created in one of the three representations. In most cases this will be the representation for which the &quot;conceptual&quot; representation in which the calculation was done is the defining attribute.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Iterated operations (like forming the product over a list) therefore will tend to stay in the most suitable representation and the calculation of another conceptual representation (which may be comparatively expensive in certain circumstances) is not necessary.</p> </body>
