      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">37.6 <span class="Heading">Representations for Associative Words</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> provides two different internal kinds of representations of associative words. The first one are &quot;syllable representations&quot; in which words are stored in syllable (i.e. generator,exponent) form. (Older versions of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> only used this representation.) The second kind are &quot;letter representations&quot; in which each letter in a word is represented by its index number. Negative numbers are used for inverses. Unless the syllable representation is specified explicitly when creating the free group/monoid or semigroup, a letter representation is used by default.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Depending on the task in mind, either of these two representations will perform better in time or in memory use and algorithms that are syllable or letter based (for example <code class="func">GeneratorSyllable</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap37_mj.html#X7F2A8CFD811C73B1"><span class="RefLink">37.5-3</span></a>) and <code class="func">Subword</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap37_mj.html#X82CC92C17AF6FFA0"><span class="RefLink">37.4-3</span></a>)) perform substantially better in the corresponding representation. For example when creating pc groups (seeÂ <a shape="rect" href="chap46_mj.html#X7EAD57C97EBF7E67"><span class="RefLink">46</span></a>), it is advantageous to use a syllable representation while calculations in free groups usually benefit from using a letter representation.</p> </body>
