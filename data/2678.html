      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1.2 <span class="Heading">Authors and Maintainers</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> is the work of very many people, many of whom still maintain parts of the system. A complete list of authors, and an approximation to the current list of maintainers can be found on the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> World Wide Web site at <span class="URL"><a shape="rect" href="http://www.gap-system.org/Contacts/People/authors.html">http://www.gap-system.org/Contacts/People/authors.html</a></span> and <span class="URL"><a shape="rect" href="http://www.gap-system.org/Contacts/People/modules.html">http://www.gap-system.org/Contacts/People/modules.html</a></span>. All <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> packages have their own authors and maintainers. It should however be noted that some packages provide interfaces between <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> and an external program, a copy of which is included for convenience, and that, in these cases, we do not claim that the package authors or maintainers wrote, or maintain, this external program. Similarly, the system and some packages include large data libraries that may have been computed by many people. We try to make clear in each case what credit is attributable to whom.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have, for some time, operated a refereeing system for contributed packages, both to ensure the quality of the software we distribute, and to provide recognition for the authors. We now consider this to be a refereeing system for modules, and we would note, in particular that, although it does not use the standard package interface, the library of small groups has been refereed and accepted on exactly the same basis as the accepted packages.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also include with this distribution a number of packages which have not (yet) gone through our refereeing process. Some may be accepted in the future, in other cases the authors have chosen not to submit them. More information can be found on our World Wide Web site (see Section <a shape="rect" href="chap1_mj.html#X7B488D2E8492AB6A"><span class="RefLink">1.5</span></a>).</p> </body>
