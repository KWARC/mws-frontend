      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">13.4 <span class="Heading">Representation</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <em>representation</em> of an object is a set of filters (see <a shape="rect" href="chap13_mj.html#X84EFA4C07D4277BB"><span class="RefLink">13.2</span></a>) that determines how an object is actually represented. For example, a matrix or a polynomial can be stored sparsely or densely; all dense polynomials form a representation. An object which claims to lie in a certain representation is accepting the requirement that certain fields in the data structure be present and have specified meanings.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> distinguishes four essentially different ways to represent objects. First there are the representations <code class="code">IsInternalRep</code> for internal objects such as integers and permutations, and <code class="code">IsDataObjectRep</code> for other objects that are created and whose data are accessible only by kernel functions. The data structures underlying such objects cannot be manipulated at the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> level.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All other objects are either in the representation <code class="code">IsComponentObjectRep</code> or in the representation <code class="code">IsPositionalObjectRep</code>, see <a shape="rect" href="chap79_mj.html#X866E223484649E5A"><span class="RefLink">79.10</span></a> and <a shape="rect" href="chap79_mj.html#X834893D07FAA6FD2"><span class="RefLink">79.11</span></a>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An object can belong to several representations in the sense that it lies in several subrepresentations of <code class="code">IsComponentObjectRep</code> or of <code class="code">IsPositionalObjectRep</code>. The representations to which an object belongs should form a chain and either two representations are disjoint or one is contained in the other. So the subrepresentations of <code class="code">IsComponentObjectRep</code> and <code class="code">IsPositionalObjectRep</code> each form trees. In the language of Object Oriented Programming, we support only single inheritance for representations.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These trees are typically rather shallow, since for one representation to be contained in another implies that all the components of the data structure implied by the containing representation, are present in, and have the same meaning in, the smaller representation (whose data structure presumably contains some additional components).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Objects may change their representation, for example a mutable list of characters can be converted into a string.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All representations in the library are created during initialization, in particular they are not created dynamically at runtime.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examples of subrepresentations of <code class="code">IsPositionalObjectRep</code> are <code class="code">IsModulusRep</code>, which is used for residue classes in the ring of integers, and <code class="code">IsDenseCoeffVectorRep</code>, which is used for elements of algebras that are defined by structure constants.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important subrepresentation of <code class="code">IsComponentObjectRep</code> is <code class="code">IsAttributeStoringRep</code>, which is used for many domains and some other objects. It provides automatic storing of all attribute values (see below).</p> </body>
