      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">82.1 <span class="Heading">New Arithmetic Operations vs. New Objects</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A usual procedure in mathematics is the definition of new operations for given objects; here are a few typical examples. The Lie bracket defines an interesting new multiplicative structure on a given (associative) algebra. Forming a group ring can be viewed as defining a new addition for the elements of the given group, and extending the multiplication to sums of group elements in a natural way. Forming the exterior algebra of a given vector space can be viewed as defining a new multiplication for the vectors in a natural way.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> does <em>not</em> support such a procedure. The main reason for this is that in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>, the multiplication in a group, a ring etc. is always written as <code class="code">*</code>, and the addition in a vector space, a ring etc.  is always written as <code class="code">+</code>. Therefore it is not possible to define the Lie bracket as a &quot;second multiplication&quot; for the elements of a given algebra; in fact, the multiplication in Lie algebras in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> is denoted by <code class="code">*</code>. Analogously, constructing the group ring as sketched above is impossible if an addition is already defined for the elements; note the difference between the usual addition of matrices and the addition in the group ring of a matrix group! (See Chapter <a shape="rect" href="chap65_mj.html#X825897DC7A16E07D"><span class="RefLink">65</span></a> for an example.) Similarly, there is already a multiplication defined for row vectors (yielding the standard scalar product), hence these vectors cannot be regarded as elements of the exterior algebra of the space.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In situations such as the ones mentioned above, <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>'s way to deal with the structures in question is the following. Instead of defining <em>new</em> operations for the <em>given</em> objects, <em>new</em> objects are created to which the <em>given</em> arithmetic operations <code class="code">*</code> and <code class="code">+</code> are then made applicable.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With this construction, matrix Lie algebras consist of matrices that are different from the matrices with associative multiplication; technically, the type of a matrix determines how it is multiplied with other matrices (see <code class="func">IsMatrix</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap24_mj.html#X7E1AE46B862B185F"><span class="RefLink">24.2-1</span></a>)). A matrix with the Lie bracket as its multiplication can be created with the function <code class="func">LieObject</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap64_mj.html#X87F121978775AF48"><span class="RefLink">64.1-1</span></a>) from a matrix with the usual associative multiplication.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Group rings (more general: magma rings, see Chapter <a shape="rect" href="chap65_mj.html#X825897DC7A16E07D"><span class="RefLink">65</span></a>) can be constructed with <code class="func">FreeMagmaRing</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap65_mj.html#X7B9AF0A47F44E4B4"><span class="RefLink">65.1-1</span></a>) from a coefficient ring and a group. The elements of the group are not contained in such a group ring, one has to use an embedding map for creating a group ring element that corresponds to a given group element.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It should be noted that the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> approach to the construction of Lie algebras from associative algebras is generic in the sense that all objects in the filter <code class="func">IsLieObject</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap64_mj.html#X83E5DD4381D9A65D"><span class="RefLink">64.1-2</span></a>) use the same methods for their addition, multiplication etc., by delegating to the &quot;underlying&quot; objects of the associative algebra, no matter what these objects actually are. Analogously, also the construction of group rings is generic.</p> </body>
