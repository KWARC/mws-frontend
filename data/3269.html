      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40.1 <span class="Heading">Creating Group Homomorphisms</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most important way of creating group homomorphisms is to give images for a set of group generators and to extend it to the group generated by them by the homomorphism property.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><em>A second</em> way to create homomorphisms is to give functions that compute image and preimage. (A similar case are homomorphisms that are induced by conjugation. Special constructors for such mappings are described in section <a shape="rect" href="chap40_mj.html#X783030917CB43959"><span class="RefLink">40.6</span></a>).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><em>The third</em> class are epimorphisms from a group onto its factor group. Such homomorphisms can be constructed by <code class="func">NaturalHomomorphismByNormalSubgroup</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap39_mj.html#X80FC390C7F38A13F"><span class="RefLink">39.18-1</span></a>).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><em>The fourth</em> class is homomorphisms in a permutation group that are induced by an action on a set. Such homomorphisms are described in the context of group actions, see chapter <a shape="rect" href="chap41_mj.html#X87115591851FB7F4"><span class="RefLink">41</span></a> and in particular <code class="func">ActionHomomorphism</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap41_mj.html#X78E6A002835288A4"><span class="RefLink">41.7-1</span></a>).</p> </body>
