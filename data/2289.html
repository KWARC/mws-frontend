It prints an overview about the installed methods for those arguments the operation was called with (using <a shape="rect" href="chap7_mj.html#X7FDA1D4B87BD25A8"><span class="RefLink">7.2</span></a>. The verbosity can be controlled by the optional integer parameter <var class="Arg">verbosity</var>. The default is 2, which lists all applicable methods. With verbosity 1 <code class="func">ShowMethods</code> only shows the number of installed methods and the methods matching, which can only be those that were already called but refused to work by calling <code class="func">TryNextMethod</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap78_mj.html#X7EED949B83046A7F"><span class="RefLink">78.4-1</span></a>). With verbosity 3 not only all installed methods but also the reasons why they do not match are displayed.</p> </body>
