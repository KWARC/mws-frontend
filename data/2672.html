For example, the family of elements of a finitely presented group is created only after the presentation has been constructed. Thus families are the dynamic part of the type system, that is, the part that is not fixed after the initialisation of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Families can be parametrized. For example, the elements of each finitely presented group form a family of their own. Here the family of elements and the finitely presented group coincide when viewed as sets. Note that elements in different finitely presented groups lie in different families. This distinction allows <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> to forbid multiplications of elements in different finitely presented groups.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a special case, families can be parametrized by other families. An important example is the family of <em>collections</em> that can be formed for each family. A collection consists of objects that lie in the same family, it is either a nonempty dense list of objects from the same family or a domain.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that every domain is a collection, that is, it is not possible to construct domains whose elements lie in different families. For example, a polynomial ring over the rationals cannot contain the integer <code class="code">0</code> because the family that contains the integers does not contain polynomials. So one has to distinguish the integer zero from each zero polynomial.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Let us look at this example from a different viewpoint. A polynomial ring and its coefficients ring lie in different families, hence the coefficients ring cannot be embedded &quot;naturally&quot; into the polynomial ring in the sense that it is a subset. But it is possible to allow, e.g., the multiplication of an integer and a polynomial over the integers. The relation between the arguments, namely that one is a coefficient and the other a polynomial, can be detected from the relation of their families. Moreover, this analysis is easier than in a situation where the rationals would lie in one family together with all polynomials over the rationals, because then the relation of families would not distinguish the multiplication of two polynomials, the multiplication of two coefficients, and the multiplication of a coefficient with a polynomial. So the wish to describe relations between elements can be taken as a motivation for the introduction of families.</p> </body>
