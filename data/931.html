Some of them were never implemented and it was unclear which commands to use. The functionality of all of these commands is now available with <code class="func">NormalFormIntMat</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap25_mj.html#X81FB746E82BE6CDA"><span class="RefLink">25.2-9</span></a>) and a few interface functions.</p> </body>
