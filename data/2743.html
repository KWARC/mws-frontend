      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">39.25 <span class="Heading">Tests for the Availability of Methods</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following filters and operations indicate capabilities of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>. They can be used in the method selection or algorithms to check whether it is feasible to compute certain operations for a given group. In general, they return <code class="keyw">true</code> if good algorithms for the given arguments are available in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>. An answer <code class="keyw">false</code> indicates that no method for this group may exist, or that the existing methods might run into problems.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Typical examples when this might happen is with finitely presented groups, for which many of the methods cannot be guaranteed to succeed in all situations.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The willingness of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> to perform certain operations may change, depending on which further information is known about the arguments. Therefore the filters used are not implemented as properties but as &quot;other filters&quot; (see <a shape="rect" href="chap13_mj.html#X871597447BB998A1"><span class="RefLink">13.7</span></a> and <a shape="rect" href="chap13_mj.html#X7997705185C7E720"><span class="RefLink">13.8</span></a>).</p> </body>
