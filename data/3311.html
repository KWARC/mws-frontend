      <body> <h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">80.8-2 <span class="Heading">Example: Groups with a word length</span></h5><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our second example is that of groups for whose elements a <em>word length</em> is defined. (We assume that the word length is only defined in the context of the group with respect to a preselected generating set but not for single elements alone. However we will not delve into any details of how this length is defined and how it could be computed.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Having a word length is a feature which enables other operations (for example a &quot;word length&quot; function). This is exactly what categories are intended for and therefore we use one.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, we declare the category. All objects in this category are groups and so we inherit the supercategory <code class="func">IsGroup</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap39_mj.html#X7939B3177BBD61E4"><span class="RefLink">39.2-7</span></a>):</p><div class="example" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><pre xml:space="preserve">
DeclareCategory(&quot;IsGroupWithWordLength&quot;,IsGroup);
</pre></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also define the operation which is &quot;enabled&quot; by this category, the word length of a group element, which is defined for a group and an element (remember that group elements are described by the category <code class="func">IsMultiplicativeElementWithInverse</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap31_mj.html#X7FDB14E57814FA3B"><span class="RefLink">31.14-13</span></a>)):</p><div class="example" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><pre xml:space="preserve">
DeclareOperation(&quot;WordLengthOfElement&quot;,[IsGroupWithWordLength,
  IsMultiplicativeElementWithInverse]);
</pre></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then would proceed by installing methods to compute the word length in concrete cases and might for example add further operations to get shortest words in cosets.</p> </body>
