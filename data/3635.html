      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">10.8 <span class="Heading">Input-Output Streams</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Input-output streams capture bidirectional communications between <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> and another process, either locally or (@as yet unimplemented@) remotely.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Such streams support the basic operations of both input and output streams. They should provide some buffering, allowing output data to be written to the stream, even when input data is waiting to be read, but the amount of this buffering is operating system dependent, and the user should take care not to get too far ahead in writing, or behind in reading, or deadlock may occur.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At present the only type of Input-Output streams that are implemented provide communication with a local child process, using a pseudo-tty.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Like other streams, write operations are blocking, read operations will block to get the first character, but not thereafter.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As far as possible, no translation is done on characters written to, or read from the stream, and no control characters have special effects, but the details of particular pseudo-tty implementations may effect this.</p> </body>
