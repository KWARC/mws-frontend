      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">71.17 <span class="Heading">Advanced Methods for Dixon-Schneider Calculations</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The computation of irreducible characters of very large groups may take quite some time. On the other hand, for the expert only a few irreducible characters may be needed, since the other ones can be computed using character theoretic methods such as tensoring, induction, and restriction. Thus <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> provides also step-by-step routines for doing the calculations. These routines allow one to compute some characters and to stop before all are calculated. Note that there is no &quot;safety net&quot;: The routines (being somehow internal) do no error checking, and assume the information given is correct.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the info level of <code class="func">InfoCharacterTable</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap71_mj.html#X7C6F3D947E5188D1"><span class="RefLink">71.4-2</span></a>) if positive, information about the progress of splitting is printed. (The default value is zero.)</p> </body>
