      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50.6 <span class="Heading">Transitive Permutation Groups</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The transitive groups library currently contains representatives for all transitive permutation groups of degree at most 30. Two permutations groups of the same degree are considered to be equivalent, if there is a renumbering of points, which maps one group into the other one. In other words, if they lie in the same conjugacy class under operation of the full symmetric group by conjugation.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The selection functions (seeÂ <a shape="rect" href="chap50_mj.html#X82676ED5826E9E2E"><span class="RefLink">50.5</span></a>) for the transitive groups library are <code class="code">AllTransitiveGroups</code> and <code class="code">OneTransitiveGroup</code>. They obtain the following attributes from the database without having to compute them anew:</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><code class="func">NrMovedPoints</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap42_mj.html#X85E7B1E28430F49E"><span class="RefLink">42.3-4</span></a>), <code class="func">Size</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap30_mj.html#X858ADA3B7A684421"><span class="RefLink">30.4-6</span></a>), <code class="func">Transitivity</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap41_mj.html#X8295D733796B7A37"><span class="RefLink">41.10-2</span></a>), and <code class="func">IsPrimitive</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap41_mj.html#X84C19AD68247B760"><span class="RefLink">41.10-7</span></a>).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This library was computed by Gregory Butler, John McKay, Gordon Royle and Alexander Hulpke. The list of transitive groups up to degree 11 was published in <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBBM83">[BM83]</a>, the list of degree 12 was published in <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBRoy87">[Roy87]</a>, degree 14 and 15 were published in <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBButler93">[But93]</a> and degrees 16-30 were published in <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBHulpke96">[Hul96]</a> and <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBHulpkeTG">[Hul05]</a>. (Groups of prime degree of course are primitive and were known long before.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The arrangement and the names of the groups of degree up to 15 is the same as given in <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBConwayHulpkeMcKay98">[CHM98]</a>. With the exception of the symmetric and alternating group (which are represented as <code class="func">SymmetricGroup</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap50_mj.html#X858666F97BD85ABB"><span class="RefLink">50.1-10</span></a>) and <code class="func">AlternatingGroup</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap50_mj.html#X7E54D3E778E6A53E"><span class="RefLink">50.1-9</span></a>)) the generators for these groups also conform to this paper with the only difference that 0 (which is not permitted in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> for permutations to act on) is always replaced by the degree.</p> </body>
