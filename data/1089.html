      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">12.1 <span class="Heading">Objects</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nearly all things one deals with in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> are <em>objects</em>. For example, an integer is an object, as is a list of integers, a matrix, a permutation, a function, a list of functions, a record, a group, a coset or a conjugacy class in a group.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examples of things that are not objects are comments which are only lexical constructs, <code class="keyw">while</code> loops which are only syntactical constructs, and expressions, such as <code class="code">1 + 1</code>; but note that the value of an expression, in this case the integer <code class="code">2</code>, is an object.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Objects can be assigned to variables, and everything that can be assigned to a variable is an object. Analogously, objects can be used as arguments of functions, and can be returned by functions.</p> </body>
