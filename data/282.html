      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2 <span class="Heading">The gap.ini and gaprc files</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When you start <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>, it looks for files with the names <code class="file">gap.ini</code> and <code class="file">gaprc</code> in its root directories (see <a shape="rect" href="chap9_mj.html#X7A4973627A5DB27D"><span class="RefLink">9.2</span></a>), and reads the first <code class="file">gap.ini</code> and the first <code class="file">gaprc</code> file it finds. These files are used for certain initializations, as follows.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The file <code class="file">gap.ini</code> is read early in the startup process. Therefore, the parameters set in this file can influence the startup process, such as which packages are automatically loaded (see <code class="func">LoadPackage</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap76_mj.html#X79B373A77B29D1F5"><span class="RefLink">76.2-1</span></a>)) and whether library files containing obsolete variables are read (see Chapter <a shape="rect" href="chap77_mj.html#X78C85ED17F00DCC1"><span class="RefLink">77</span></a>). On the other hand, only calls to a restricted set of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> functions are allowed in a <code class="file">gap.ini</code> file. Usually, it should only contain calls of <code class="func">SetUserPreference</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap3_mj.html#X7B0AD104839B6C3C"><span class="RefLink">3.2-3</span></a>). This file can be generated (or updated when new releases introduce further user preferences) with the command <code class="func">WriteGapIniFile</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap3_mj.html#X7B0AD104839B6C3C"><span class="RefLink">3.2-3</span></a>). This file is read whenever <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> is started, with or without a workspace.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The file <code class="file">gaprc</code> is read after the startup process, before the first input file given on the command line (see <a shape="rect" href="chap3_mj.html#X782751D5858A6EAF"><span class="RefLink">3.1</span></a>). So the contents of this file cannot influence the startup process, but all <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> library functions can be called in this file. When <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> is started with a workspace then the file is read only if no <code class="file">gaprc</code> file had been read before the workspace was created. (With this setup, it is on the one hand possible that administrators provide a <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> workspace for several users such that the user's <code class="file">gaprc</code> file is read when <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> is started with the workspace, and on the other hand one can start <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>, read one's <code class="file">gaprc</code> file, save a workspace, and then start from this workspace <em>without</em> reading one's <code class="file">gaprc</code> file again.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that by default, the user specific <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> root directory <code class="code">GAPInfo.UserGapRoot</code> is the first <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> root directory. So you can put your <code class="file">gap.ini</code> and <code class="file">gaprc</code> files into this directory.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This mechanism substitutes the much less flexible reading of a users <code class="file">.gaprc</code> file in versions of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> up to 4.4. For compatibility this <code class="file">.gaprc</code> file is still read if the directory <code class="code">GAPInfo.UserGapRoot</code> does not exist, see <a shape="rect" href="chap77_mj.html#X7F2FF72A7AD60E0C"><span class="RefLink">77.5</span></a> how to migrate your old setup.</p> </body>
