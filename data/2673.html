      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">13.1 <span class="Heading">Families</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The family of an object determines its relationship to other objects.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More precisely, the families form a partition of all <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> objects such that the following two conditions hold: objects that are equal w.r.t. <code class="code">=</code> lie in the same family; and the family of the result of an operation depends only on the families of its operands.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first condition means that a family can be regarded as a set of elements instead of a set of objects. Note that this does not hold for categories and representations (see below), two objects that are equal w.r.t. <code class="code">=</code> need not lie in the same categories and representations. For example, a sparsely represented matrix can be equal to a densely represented matrix. Similarly, each domain is equal w.r.t. <code class="code">=</code> to the sorted list of its elements, but a domain is not a list, and a list is not a domain.</p> </body>
