      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">48.6 <span class="Heading">Tietze Transformations</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The commands in this section can be used to modify a presentation by Tietze transformations.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, the aim of such modifications will be to <em>simplify</em> the given presentation, i.e., to reduce the number of generators and the number of relators without increasing too much the sum of all relator lengths which we will call the <em>total length</em> of the presentation. Depending on the concrete presentation under investigation one may end up with a nice, short presentation or with a very huge one.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unfortunately there is no algorithm which could be applied to find the shortest presentation which can be obtained by Tietze transformations from a given one. Therefore, what <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> offers are some lower-level Tietze transformation commands and, in addition, some higher-level commands which apply the lower-level ones in a kind of default strategy which of course cannot be the optimal choice for all presentations.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The design of these commands follows closely the concept of the ANU Tietze transformation program <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBHav69">[Hav69]</a> and its later revisions (see <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBHKRR84">[HKRR84]</a>, <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBRob88">[Rob88]</a>).</p> </body>
