Such objects are called <em>domains</em>. The equality relation between domains is always equality <em>as sets</em>, so that two domains are equal if and only if they contain the same elements.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Domains play a central role in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>. In a sense, the only reason that <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> supports objects such as integers and permutations is the wish to form domains of them and compute the properties of those domains.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Domains are described in ChapterÂ <a shape="rect" href="chap31_mj.html#X7E651AC287AFDCC1"><span class="RefLink">31</span></a>.</p> </body>
