In particular, if the semigroup or monoid <var class="Arg">S</var> does not have a solvable word problem then it this will certainly never end. Also, in this case, the object returned is an immutable rewriting system, because once we have a confluent rewriting system for a finitely presented semigroup or monoid we do not want to allow it to change (as it was most probably very time consuming to get it in the first place).

</pre></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The creation of a reduced confluent rewriting system for a semigroup or for a monoid, in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>, uses the Knuth-Bendix procedure for strings, which manipulates a rewriting system of the semigroup or monoid and attempts to make it confluent (See <a shape="rect" href="chap38_mj.html#X7CA8FCFD81AA1890"><span class="RefLink">38</span></a>. See also Sims <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBSims94">[Sim94]</a>). (Since the word problem for semigroups/monoids is not solvable in general, Knuth-Bendix procedure cannot always terminate).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to apply this procedure we will build a rewriting system for the semigroup or monoid, which we will call a <em>Knuth-Bendix Rewriting System</em> (we need to define this because we need the rewriting system to store some information needed for the implementation of the Knuth-Bendix procedure).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Actually, Knuth-Bendix Rewriting Systems do not only serve this purpose. Indeed these are objects which are mutable and which can be manipulated (see <a shape="rect" href="chap38_mj.html#X7CA8FCFD81AA1890"><span class="RefLink">38</span></a>).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that the implemented version of the Knuth-Bendix procedure, in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> returns, if it terminates, a confluent rewriting system which is reduced. Also, a reduction ordering has to be specified when building a rewriting system. If none is specified, the shortlex ordering is assumed (note that the procedure may terminate with a certain ordering and not with another one).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On Unix systems it is possible to replace the built-in Knuth-Bendix by other routines, for example the package <strong class="pkg">kbmag</strong> offers such a possibility.</p> </body>
