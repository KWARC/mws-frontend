      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">80.8 <span class="Heading">Adding new Concepts</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Now we look how to implement a new concept for existing objects and fit this in the method selection. Three examples that will be made more explicit below would be groups for which a &quot;length&quot; of elements (as a word in certain generators) is defined, groups that can be decomposed as a semidirect product and M-groups.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In each case we have two possibilities for the declaration. We can either declare it as a property or as a category. Both are eventually filter(s) and in this way indistinguishable for the method selection. However, the value of a property for a particular object can be unknown at first and later in the session be computed (to be <code class="keyw">true</code> or <code class="keyw">false</code>). This is implemented by reserving two filters for each property, one indicating whether the property value is known, and one, provided the value is known, to indicate the actual boolean value. Contrary to this, the decision whether or not an object lies in a category is taken at creation time and this is implemented using a single filter.</p><dl xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><dt><strong class="Mark">Property:</strong></dt><dd><p>Properties also are attributes: If a property value is not known for an object, <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> tries to find a method to compute the property value. If no suitable method is found, an error is raised.</p>

</dd><dt><strong class="Mark">Category:</strong></dt><dd><p>An object is in a category if it has been created in it. Testing the category for an object simply returns this value. Existing objects cannot enter a new category later in life. This means that in most cases one has to write own code to create objects in a new category.</p>

<p>If we want to implement a completely new concept so that new operations are defined only for the new objects –for example bialgebras for which a second scalar multiplication is defined– usually a category is chosen.</p>

<p>Technically, the behaviour of the category <code class="code">IsXYZ</code>, declared as subcategory of <code class="code">IsABC</code> is therefore exactly the same as if we would declare <code class="code">IsXYZ</code> to be a property for <code class="code">IsABC</code> and install the following method:</p>


<div class="example"><pre xml:space="preserve">
InstallMethod(IsXYZ,&quot;return false if not known&quot;,[IsABC],ReturnFalse);
</pre></div>

<p>(The word <code class="code">category</code> also has a well-defined mathematical meaning, but this does not need to concern us at this point. The set of objects which is defined to be a (<strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>) category does not need to be a category in the mathematical sense, vice versa not every mathematical category is declared as a (<strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>) category.)</p>

</dd></dl><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eventually the choice between category and property often becomes a matter of taste or style.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sometimes there is even a third possibility (if you have <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> 3 experience this might reflect most closely &quot;an object whose operations record is <code class="code">XYOps</code>&quot;): We might want to indicate this new concept simply by the fact that certain attributes are set. In this case we could simply use the respective attribute tester(s).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The examples given below each give a short argument why the respective solution was chosen, but one could argue as well for other choices.</p> </body>
