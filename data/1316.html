As any ordering that is guaranteed to be reproducible in different runs of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> or even with different groups given by syntactically equal presentations would be prohibitively expensive to implement, the ordering of elements is depending on a method chosen by <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> and not guaranteed to stay the same when repeating the construction of an FpGroup. The only guarantee given for the <code class="code">&lt;</code> ordering for such elements is that it will stay the same for one family during its lifetime. The attribute <code class="func">FpElmComparisonMethod</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap47_mj.html#X87512CF485CC4128"><span class="RefLink">47.3-3</span></a>) is used to obtain a comparison function for a family of FpGroup elements.</p> </body>
