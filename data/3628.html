      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">10.10 <span class="Heading">Handling of Streams in the Background</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This section describes a feature of the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> kernel that can be used to handle pending streams somehow &quot;in the background&quot;. This is currently not available on the Macintosh architecture and only on operating systems that have <code class="code">select</code>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Right before <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> reads a keypress from the keyboard it calls a little subroutine that can handle streams that are ready to be read or ready to be written. This means that <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> can handle these streams during user input on the command line. Note that this does not work when <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> is in the middle of some calculation.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This feature is used in the following way. One can install handler functions for reading or writing streams via <code class="func">InstallCharReadHookFunc</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap10_mj.html#X81FB42517E3EA96D"><span class="RefLink">10.10-1</span></a>). Handlers can be removed via <code class="func">UnInstallCharReadHookFunc</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap10_mj.html#X8492474C7A0B10AD"><span class="RefLink">10.10-2</span></a>)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that handler functions must not return anything and get one integer argument, which refers to an index in one of the following arrays (according to whether the function was installed for input, output or exceptions on the stream). Handler functions usually should not output anything on the standard output because this ruins the command line during command line editing.</p> </body>
