      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">9.5 <span class="Heading">Special Filenames</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The special filename <code class="code">&quot;*stdin*&quot;</code> denotes the standard input, i.e., the stream through which the user enters commands to <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>. The exact behaviour of reading from <code class="code">&quot;*stdin*&quot;</code> is operating system dependent, but usually the following happens. If <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> was started with no input redirection, statements are read from the terminal stream until the user enters the end of file character, which is usually <strong class="button">Ctrl-D</strong>. Note that terminal streams are special, in that they may yield ordinary input <em>after</em> an end of file. Thus when control returns to the main read-eval-print loop the user can continue with <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>. If <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> was started with an input redirection, statements are read from the current position in the input file up to the end of the file. When control returns to the main read eval view loop the input stream will still return end of file, and <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> will terminate.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The special filename <code class="code">&quot;*errin*&quot;</code> denotes the stream connected to the UNIX <code class="code">stderr</code> output. This stream is usually connected to the terminal, even if the standard input was redirected, unless the standard error stream was also redirected, in which case opening of <code class="code">&quot;*errin*&quot;</code> fails.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The special filename <code class="code">&quot;*stdout*&quot;</code> can be used to print to the standard output.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The special filename <code class="code">&quot;*errout*&quot;</code> can be used to print to the standard error output file, which is usually connected to the terminal, even if the standard output was redirected.</p> </body>
