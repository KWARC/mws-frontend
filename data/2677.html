      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1.3 <span class="Heading">Acknowledgements</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Very many people have worked on, and contributed to, <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> over the years since its inception. On our Web site you will find the prefaces to the previous releases, each of which acknowledges people who have made special contributions to that release. Even so, it is appropriate to mention here Joachim Neubüser whose vision of a free, open and extensible system for computational algebra inspired <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> in the first place, and Martin Schönert, who was the technical architect of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> 3 and <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> 4.</p> </body>
