Methods based on the low-level functions in the previous section, are installed for the list access operations, enabling them to be used as lists. However, it is <em>not recommended</em> that these be used in programming. They are supplied mainly as a convenience for interactive working, and may not be safe, since functions and methods for lists may assume that after <code class="code">IsBound(w[i])</code> returns <code class="keyw">true</code>, access to <code class="code">w[i]</code> is safe.</p> </body>
