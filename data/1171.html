      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45.6 <span class="Heading">Exponents of Special Products</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are certain products of elements whose exponents are used often within algorithms, and which might be obtained more easily than by computing the product first and to obtain its exponents afterwards. The operations in this section provide a way to obtain such exponent vectors directly.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(The circumstances under which these operations give a speedup depend very much on the pcgs and the representation of elements that is used. So the following operations are not guaranteed to give a speedup in every case, however the default methods are not slower than to compute the exponents of a product and thus these operations should <em>always</em> be used if applicable.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second class are exponents of products of the generators which make up the pcgs. If the pcgs used is a family pcgs (see <code class="func">FamilyPcgs</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap46_mj.html#X79EDB35E82C99304"><span class="RefLink">46.1-1</span></a>)) then these exponents can be looked up and do not need to be computed.</p> </body>
