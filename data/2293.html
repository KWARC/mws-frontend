Error, no method found! For debugging hints type ?Recovery from NoMethodFound
Error, no 1st choice method found for `IsNormal' on 2 arguments called from
&lt;function&gt;( &lt;arguments&gt; ) called from read-eval-loop
Entering break read-eval-print loop ...
you can 'quit;' to quit to outer loop, or
you can 'return;' to continue
<span class="GAPbrkprompt">brk&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput"/>
</pre></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This only says, that the method selection tried to find a method for <code class="code">IsNormal</code> on two arguments and failed. In this situation it is crucial to find out, why this happened. Therefore there are a few functions which can display further information. Note that you can leave the break loop by the <code class="keyw">quit</code> command (seeÂ <a shape="rect" href="chap6_mj.html#X83033EEB81CF4F49"><span class="RefLink">6.4-1</span></a>) and that the information about the incident is no longer accessible afterwards.</p> </body>
