      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">52.6 <span class="Heading">Rewriting Systems and the Knuth-Bendix Procedure</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If a finitely presented semigroup has a confluent rewriting system then it has a solvable word problem, that is, there is an algorithm to decide when two words in the free underlying semigroup represent the same element of the finitely presented semigroup. Indeed, once we have a confluent rewriting system, it is possible to successfully test that two words represent the same element in the semigroup, by reducing both words using the rewriting system rules. This is, at the moment, the method that <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> uses to check equality in finitely presented semigroups and monoids.</p> </body>
