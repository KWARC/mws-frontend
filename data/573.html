      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.3 <span class="Heading">Changing the Help Viewer</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Books of the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> help system or package manuals can be available in several formats. Currently the following formats occur (not all of them may be available for all books):</p><dl xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><dt><strong class="Mark">text</strong></dt><dd><p>This is used for display in the terminal window in which <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> is running. Complicated mathematical expressions may not be easy to read in this format.</p>

</dd><dt><strong class="Mark">pdf</strong></dt><dd><p>Adobe's <code class="code">pdf</code> format. Can be used for printing and onscreen reading on most current systems (with freely available software). Some manual books contain hyperlinks in this format.</p>

</dd><dt><strong class="Mark">HTML</strong></dt><dd><p>The format of web pages. Can be used with any web browser. There may be hyperlink information available which allows a convenient browsing through the book via cross-references. This format has the problem that complicated formulae may be not be easy to read since there is no syntax for formulae in HTML. (Some older manual books use special symbol fonts for formulae and need a particular configuration of the web browser for correct display. Some manuals may use technology for quite sophisticated formula display.)</p>

</dd></dl><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Depending on your operating system and available additional software you can use several of these formats with <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>'s help system. This is configured with the following command.</p> </body>
