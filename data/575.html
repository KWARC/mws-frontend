      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.1 <span class="Heading">Invoking the Help</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The basic command to read <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>'s documentation from within a <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> session is as follows.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><code class="code">?[<var class="Arg">book</var>:][?]<var class="Arg">topic</var></code></p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For an explanation and some examples see <a shape="rect" href="../../doc/tut/chap2_mj.html#X7A7EADB77FF38BC9"><span class="RefLink">Tutorial: Help</span></a>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that the first question mark must appear in the <em>first position</em> after the <code class="code">gap&gt; </code> prompt. The search strings <var class="Arg">book</var> and <var class="Arg">topic</var> are normalized in a certain way (see the end of this section for details) before the search starts. This makes the search case insensitive and there can be arbitrary white space after the first question mark.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When there are several manual sections that match the query a numbered list of topics is displayed. These matches can be accessed with <code class="code">?<var class="Arg">number</var></code>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are some further specially handled commands which start with a question mark. They are explained in Section <a shape="rect" href="chap2_mj.html#X7BE8068878B7D7D1"><span class="RefLink">2.2</span></a>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By default <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> shows the help sections as text in the terminal (window), page by page if the shown text does not fit on the screen. But there are several other choices to read (other formats of) the documents: via a viewer for <code class="code">pdf</code> files or via a web browser. This is explained below in Section <a shape="rect" href="chap2_mj.html#X863FF9087EDA8DF9"><span class="RefLink">2.3</span></a>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><em>Details of the string normalization process</em></p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here is a precise description how the search strings <var class="Arg">book</var> and <var class="Arg">topic</var> are normalized before a search starts: backslashes and double or single quotes are removed, parentheses and braces are substituted by blanks, non-ASCII characters are considered as ISO-latin1 characters and the accented letters are substituted by their non-accented counterpart. Finally white space is normalized.</p> </body>
