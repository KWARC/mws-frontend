(So every element takes only small extra storage for the straight line program.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A straight line program element has a <em>seed</em> (a list of group elements) and a straight line program on the same number of generators as the length of this seed, its value is the value of the evaluated straight line program.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the moment, the entries of the straight line program have to be simple lists (i.e. of the first form).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Straight line program elements are in the same categories and families as the elements of the seed, so they should work together with existing algorithms.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note however, that due to the different way of storage some normally very cheap operations (such as testing for element equality) can become more expensive when dealing with straight line program elements. This is essentially the tradeoff for using less memory.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">See also SectionÂ <a shape="rect" href="chap43_mj.html#X78A68F5A80ADD1B6"><span class="RefLink">43.13</span></a>.</p> </body>
