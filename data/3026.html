      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">48.11 <span class="Heading">Tietze Options</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several of the Tietze transformation commands described above are controlled by certain parameters, the <em>Tietze options</em>, which often have a tremendous influence on their performance and results. However, in each application of the commands, an appropriate choice of these option parameters will depend on the concrete presentation under investigation. Therefore we have implemented the Tietze options in such a way that they are associated to the presentation: Each presentation keeps its own set of Tietze option parameters as an attribute.</p> </body>
