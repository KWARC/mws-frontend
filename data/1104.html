      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45.15 <span class="Heading">Orbit Stabilizer Methods for Polycyclic Groups</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If a pcgs <var class="Arg">pcgs</var> is known for a group <var class="Arg">G</var>, then orbits and stabilizers can be computed by a special method which is particularly efficient. Note that within this function only the elements in <var class="Arg">pcgs</var> and the relative orders of <var class="Arg">pcgs</var> are needed. Hence this function works effectively even if the elementary operations for <var class="Arg">pcgs</var> are slow.</p> </body>
