      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40.3 <span class="Heading">Efficiency of Homomorphisms</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> permits to create homomorphisms between arbitrary groups. This section considers the efficiency of the implementation and shows ways how to choose suitable representations. For permutation groups (see <a shape="rect" href="chap43_mj.html#X85ED46007CED6191"><span class="RefLink">43</span></a>) or Pc groups (see <a shape="rect" href="chap46_mj.html#X7EAD57C97EBF7E67"><span class="RefLink">46</span></a>) this is normally nothing to worry about, unless the groups get extremely large. For other groups however certain calculations might be expensive and some precaution might be needed to avoid unnecessarily expensive calculations.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In short, it is always worth to tell a mapping that it is a homomorphism (this can be done by calling <code class="code">SetIsMapping</code>) (or to create it directly with <code class="func">GroupHomomorphismByImagesNC</code> (<a shape="rect" href="chap40_mj.html#X7AB15AF5830F2A6B"><span class="RefLink">40.1-2</span></a>)).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The basic operations required are to compute image and preimage of elements and to test whether a mapping is a homomorphism. Their cost will differ depending on the type of the mapping.</p> </body>
