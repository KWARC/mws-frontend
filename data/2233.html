      <body> <h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">7.11-1 GasmanStatistics</h5><div class="func" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><table width="100%" class="func"><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" class="tdleft"><code class="func">â€£ GasmanStatistics</code>(  )</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" class="tdright">( function )</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><code class="func">GasmanStatistics</code> returns a record containing some information from the garbage collection mechanism. The record may contain up to four components: <code class="code">full</code>, <code class="code">partial</code>, <code class="code">npartial</code>, and <code class="code">nfull</code>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <code class="code">full</code> component will be present if a full garbage collection has taken place since <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> started. It contains information about the most recent full garbage collection. It is a record, with six components: <code class="code">livebags</code> contains the number of bags which survived the garbage collection; <code class="code">livekb</code> contains the total number of kilobytes occupied by those bags; <code class="code">deadbags</code> contains the total number of bags which were reclaimed by that garbage collection and all the partial garbage collections preceding it, since the previous full garbage collection; <code class="code">deadkb</code> contains the total number of kilobytes occupied by those bags; <code class="code">freekb</code> reports the total number of kilobytes available in the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> workspace for new objects and <code class="code">totalkb</code> the actual size of the workspace.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These figures should be viewed with some caution. They are stored internally in fixed length integer formats, and <code class="code">deadkb</code> and <code class="code">deadbags</code> are liable to overflow if there are many partial collections before a full collection. Also, note that <code class="code">livekb</code> and <code class="code">freekb</code> will not usually add up to <code class="code">totalkb</code>. The difference is essentially the space overhead of the memory management system.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <code class="code">partial</code> component will be present if there has been a partial garbage collection since the last full one. It is also a record with the same six components as <code class="code">full</code>. In this case <code class="code">deadbags</code> and <code class="code">deadkb</code> refer only to the number and total size of the garbage bags reclaimed in this partial garbage collection and <code class="code">livebags</code>and <code class="code">livekb</code> only to the numbers and total size of the young bags that were considered for garbage collection, and survived.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <code class="code">npartial</code> and <code class="code">nfull</code> components will contain the number of full and partial garbage collections performed since <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> started.</p> </body>
