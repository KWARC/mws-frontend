      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">62.10 <span class="Heading">Homomorphisms of Algebras</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Algebra homomorphisms are vector space homomorphisms that preserve the multiplication. So the default methods for vector space homomorphisms work, and in fact there is not much use of the fact that source and range are algebras, except that preimages and images are algebras (or even ideals) in certain cases.</p> </body>
