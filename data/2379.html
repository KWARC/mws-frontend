      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">46.3 <span class="Heading">Pc groups versus fp groups</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In theory pc groups are finitely presented groups. In practice the arithmetic in pc groups is different from the arithmetic in fp groups. Thus for technical reasons the pc groups in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> do not form a subcategory of the fp groups and hence the methods for fp groups cannot be applied to pc groups in general.</p> </body>
