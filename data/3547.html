      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">23.7 <span class="Heading">Vectors as coefficients of polynomials</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A list of ring elements can be interpreted as a row vector or the list of coefficients of a polynomial. There are a couple of functions that implement arithmetic operations based on these interpretations. <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> contains proper support for polynomials (seeÂ <a shape="rect" href="chap66_mj.html#X7A14A6588268810A"><span class="RefLink">66</span></a>), the operations described in this section are on a lower level.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following operations all perform arithmetic on univariate polynomials given by their coefficient lists. These lists can have different lengths but must be dense homogeneous lists containing elements of a commutative ring. Not all input lists may be empty.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the following descriptions we will always assume that <var class="Arg">list1</var> is the coefficient list of the polynomial <var class="Arg">pol1</var> and so forth. If length parameter <var class="Arg">leni</var> is not given, it is set to the length of <var class="Arg">listi</var> by default.</p> </body>
