      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">47.13 <span class="Heading">Preimages under Homomorphisms from an FpGroup</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For some subgroups of a finitely presented group the number of subgroup generators increases with the index of the subgroup. However often these generators are not needed at all for further calculations, but what is needed is the action of the cosets of the subgroup. This gives the image of the subgroup in a finite quotient and this finite quotient can be used to calculate normalizers, closures, intersections and so forthÂ <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBHulpkeQuot">[Hul01]</a>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The same applies for subgroups that are obtained as preimages under homomorphisms.</p> </body>
