      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">87.3 <span class="Heading">Stabilizer Chains for Automorphisms Acting on Enumerators</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This section describes a way of representing the automorphism group of a group as permutation group, following <a shape="rect" href="chapBib_mj.html#biBSims97">[ACM]</a>. The code however is not yet included in the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> library.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this section we present an example in which objects we already know (namely, automorphisms of solvable groups) are equipped with the permutation-like operations <code class="code">^</code> and <code class="code">/</code> for action on positive integers. To achieve this, we must define a new type of objects which behave like permutations but are represented as automorphisms acting on an enumerator. Our goal is to generalize the Schreier-Sims algorithm for construction of a stabilizer chain to groups of such new automorphisms.</p> </body>
