      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">48.3 <span class="Heading">Relators in a Presentation</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to speed up the Tietze transformation routines, each relator in a presentation is internally represented by a list of positive or negative generator numbers, i.e., each factor of the proper <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> word is represented by the position number of the corresponding generator with respect to the current list of generators, or by the respective negative number, if the factor is the inverse of a generator. Note that the numbering of the generators in Tietze words is always relative to a generator list and bears no relation to the internal numbering of generators in a family of associative words.</p> </body>
