      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">29.7 <span class="Heading">Record Access Operations</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Internally, record accesses are done using the operations listed in this section. For the records implemented in the kernel, kernel methods are provided for all these operations but otherwise it is possible to install methods for these operations for any object. This permits objects to simulate record behavior.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To save memory, records do not store a list of all component names, but only numbers identifying the components. There numbers are called <em>RNams</em>. <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> keeps a global list of all RNams that are used and provides functions to translate RNams to strings that give the component names and vice versa.</p> </body>
