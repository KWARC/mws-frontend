      <body> <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">45.11 <span class="Heading">Pcgs and Normal Series</span></h4><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By definition, a pcgs determines a pc series of its underlying group. However, in many applications it will be necessary that this pc series refines a normal series with certain properties; for example, a normal series with abelian factors.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are functions in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> to compute a pcgs through a normal series with elementary abelian factors, a central series or the lower p-central series. See also Section <a shape="rect" href="chap45_mj.html#X83039CF97D27D819"><span class="RefLink">45.13</span></a> for a more explicit possibility.</p> </body>
