      <body> <h5 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">9.7-1 Read</h5><div class="func" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><table width="100%" class="func"><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" class="tdleft"><code class="func">‣ Read</code>( <var class="Arg">filename</var> )</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" class="tdright">( operation )</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">reads the input from the file with the filename <var class="Arg">filename</var>, which must be given as a string.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><code class="func">Read</code> first opens the file <var class="Arg">filename</var>. If the file does not exist, or if <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> cannot open it, e.g., because of access restrictions, an error is signalled.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Then the contents of the file are read and evaluated, but the results are not printed. The reading and evaluations happens exactly as described for the main loop (see <a shape="rect" href="chap6_mj.html#X81667F568237B232"><span class="RefLink">6.1</span></a>).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If a statement in the file causes an error a break loop is entered (see <a shape="rect" href="chap6_mj.html#X8593B49F8705B486"><span class="RefLink">6.4</span></a>). The input for this break loop is not taken from the file, but from the input connected to the <code class="code">stderr</code> output of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>. If <code class="code">stderr</code> is not connected to a terminal, no break loop is entered. If this break loop is left with <code class="keyw">quit</code> (or <strong class="button">Ctrl-D</strong>), <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> exits from the <code class="func">Read</code> command, and from all enclosing <code class="func">Read</code> commands, so that control is normally returned to an interactive prompt. The <code class="keyw">QUIT</code> statement (see <a shape="rect" href="chap6_mj.html#X83704B1080FD9B40"><span class="RefLink">6.7</span></a>) can also be used in the break loop to exit <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> immediately.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that a statement must not begin in one file and end in another. I.e., <em>eof</em> (<em>e</em>nd-<em>o</em>f-<em>f</em>ile) is not treated as whitespace, but as a special symbol that must not appear inside any statement.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that one file may very well contain a read statement causing another file to be read, before input is again taken from the first file. There is an upper limit of 15 on the number of files that may be open simultaneously.</p> </body>
